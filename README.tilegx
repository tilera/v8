v8 for tilegx

This 10/23/14 tilegx version of v8 is based on version V8-3.18.5, with fixes pulled in
from later versions, and some obsolete entry points from old versions added
back in.  The latter is necessary to support node.js v0.10.29.

Unsupported in this version:
  crankshaft and deoptimization
  huge branches (trampoline support is incomplete)
  LiveEdit stack manipulations 

Current Test failures
  With some tests modified for longer timeouts, the 18 remaining failures are:
  3 tests fail because of huge branches in switch statement stress tests
  12 fail with "Exception: LiveEdit Failure: 
                Stack manipulations are not supported in this architecture."
  3 fail because the large page size on tilegx invalidates the test

  See tilegx-v8-reference-testsuite-result.txt .
